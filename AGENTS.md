# AGENTS

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript with ES modules.
- Format changes with Prettier using default settings.

## Testing
- Run `pnpm test` after making changes.
- Execute any relevant additional scripts such as `pnpm run test:integration` or `pnpm run test:e2e` when your changes touch related areas.

## Git
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature").
- Keep commits focused and leave the worktree clean.
